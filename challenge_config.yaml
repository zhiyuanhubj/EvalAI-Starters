          "sort_ascending": True,
          "description": "Judgement, the ratio of correct votes, represents the accuracy of an agent’s judgment. It's essential for assessing their ability to distinguish roles based on partial information."
        },
        "Reasoning": {
          "sort_ascending": True,
          "description": "Reasoning reflects the agents' ability to logically reason the global status with partial information. It's calculated as the proportion of correct role analyses."

        "Deception": {
          "sort_ascending": True,
          "description": "Deception evaluates an agent's capability to deceive others by blending in or causing incorrect guesses. It's crucial in competitive settings."

        "Self-Awareness": {
          "sort_ascending": True,
          "description": "Self-Awareness measures correct role identification, critical for agents to function within their capabilities and indicative of their level of self-awareness."

        "Cooperation": {
          "sort_ascending": True,
          "description": "Cooperation quantifies how well agents work together, showcasing the collective efficacy of the system, especially in cost-sharing games and prisoner’s dilemma."
        },
        "Coordination": {
          "sort_ascending": True,
          "description": "Coordination is the ratio of successful collaborations proposed by the challenger LLM, reflecting the ability to work effectively with others."
        },
        "Rationality": {
          "sort_ascending": True,
          "description": "Rationality captures the agents' ability to act consistently and efficiently based on logic and evidence, particularly in prisoner's dilemma and public good games."
